# iOS Dashboard App

## Overview

A SwiftUI-based application designed to manage mock metrics for a hypothetical electric company. This app utilizes a custom-built RESTful API, deployed on a VPS, to interact with a MySQL/MariaDB database, supporting full CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD) operations.

The app is integrated with my [Database Dashboard Web Project](https://github.com/JMiller7334/Dashboard-Database-project), sharing the same backend database, creating a data management possibilities across both platforms.

## Features

- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize data with SwiftCharts for a more engaging and informative user experience.
- **Comprehensive API Integration**: Leverages a RESTful API to manage database operations efficiently.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete data through the app interface.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: For building the appâ€™s interface with a modern, declarative approach.
- **SwiftCharts**: To create interactive and dynamic charts.
- **RESTful API**: Custom-built to handle backend database interactions.
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: For data storage and management.
